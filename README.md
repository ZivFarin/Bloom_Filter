# Bloom Filter - A Data Structures & Algorithms Project

### Contains:

#### main
The main programming question of the work.
Prints what elements from CHECK_FILE(1st clients input) are recognized, through the use of a hashing table,
as elements of the DB_FILE (2nd clients input).

#### stats_sim
The bonus question.
Prints some statistics about mistakes that are made when checking if elements of one DB are elements of another (hashed) DB.
The simulation parameters can be defined in the programs constants.
